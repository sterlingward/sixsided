This is just a simple explanation of the code: 

Write a .NET console application using C# that simulates the rolling of two 6-sided dice (NOTE:
NOT a one 12-sided die.) Use an array to keep track of the number of times that each
combination is thrown. In other words, keep track of how many times the combination of the two
simulated dice is 2, how many times the combination is 3, and so on, all the way up through 12.
Allow the user to choose how many times the “dice” will be thrown. Then, once you have that
number of rolls, pass that number to a second class that has a method that simulates the roll of
the dice for the number of times that the user specified. Store the results in an array. The method
in the second class should return that array containing the roll results to the first class. In the first
class, use that array to print a histogram (using the * character) that shows the total percentage
each number was rolled. Each * will represent 1% of the total rolls.
